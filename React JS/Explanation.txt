React JS:
    --> Open Source library for building user interface
    --> Its not a frame work its a library
    --> Focus on UI
    --> it has Componenet Based Architechture
    --> Declarative
    --> JavaScript library for creating user interface
    --> Simple Componenent 
        - it has render() to render the html and function inside it 
        - Componenent mean small chunks it is the small code where added to make a page
    --> Using of it make more easier to make large or big page except from JS
        - because it makes more efficent way that we can use the repetance of Componenent in any 
        area we want

State vs Props:

    Props:
        -it is argument to a function or passing a intial argument to a Componenent
        -it is noting but storing some value which can used by the Componenent
        ex:-
            if a counter Componenent is there the start of counter is passed by Props only and the value is stored in via of Props
    
    State:
        -it is inside of the Componenent where by above example if the props intialize the intial value then if the user press the 
        Componenent then it increses or decreases its via state only where work inside the Componenent as some functionality
        -it is noting but storing the data where the user manipulation are stored in it

Axios-
